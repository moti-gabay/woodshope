      "description": "Planning and Preparation\n\n1. Determine the Application: Decide where you want to install thin bricks. Common applications include accent walls, fireplace surrounds, backsplashes, and exterior facades. Measure the area to determine the quantity of thin bricks needed.\n\n2. Choose Thin Bricks: Select the type, color, and texture of thin bricks that suit your design preferences. Consider factors such as the style of the space, existing color schemes, and personal preferences.\n\n3. Gather Materials and Tools: Purchase the necessary materials and tools. You will typically need thin bricks, adhesive mortar, grout (if desired), a trowel, a notched trowel, a wet saw or tile cutter, a level, a sponge, a bucket, and safety equipment like gloves and goggles."

      "description": "Surface Preparation\n\n1. Prepare the Surface: Ensure the surface where you will install the thin bricks is clean, dry, and free from any loose debris or paint. Remove wallpaper or any other materials that may interfere with the adhesion of the bricks.\n\n2. Apply a Primer (if necessary): Depending on the surface and the specific adhesive mortar you are using, it may be necessary to apply a primer to promote better adhesion. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the primer application."

      "stepNumber": 3,
      "description": "Installing the Thin Bricks\n\n1. Prepare the Mortar: Mix the adhesive mortar according to the manufacturer's instructions. It should have a consistency similar to that of peanut butter.\n\n2. Apply Mortar to the Wall: Using a trowel, spread a layer of adhesive mortar onto the surface. Start from the bottom and work your way up, covering an area that is manageable within the time frame specified by the mortar manufacturer.\n\n3. Place the Thin Bricks: Press the thin bricks firmly into the mortar, starting from one corner of the installation area. Apply slight pressure and wiggle the brick slightly to ensure proper adhesion. Use spacers if desired for consistent spacing between the bricks.\n\n4. Cut Bricks as Needed: Use a wet saw or tile cutter to trim bricks to fit the edges or corners of the installation area. Measure carefully and make precise cuts to ensure a clean fit.\n\n5. Check for Levelness and Alignment: Use a level frequently throughout the installation process to ensure that the bricks are level and aligned properly. Adjust as needed by tapping lightly with a rubber mallet.\n\n6. Clean Excess Mortar: Remove any excess mortar from the brick surfaces using a damp sponge. Be careful not to smear mortar into the mortar joints."

      "description": "Grouting (if desired)\n\n1. Mix Grout (if using): If you prefer a grouted look, mix the grout according to the manufacturer's instructions. Choose a color that complements your thin bricks.\n\n2. Apply Grout: Using a grout float or a trowel, spread the grout over the surface, making sure to fill the gaps between the bricks completely. Hold the float at a 45-degree angle and push the grout into the joints.\n\n3. Clean Excess Grout: After allowing the grout to set for a few minutes, gently wipe away the excess grout from the brick surfaces using a damp sponge. Rinse the sponge frequently and avoid removing too much grout from the joints."

      "description": "Finishing Touches\n\n1. Allow for Drying and Curing: Follow the manufacturer's instructions for drying and curing times of the adhesive mortar and grout. Avoid touching or disturbing the installation during this period.\n\n2. Seal (if desired): Consider applying a brick sealer to protect the surface and enhance the color and durability of the thin bricks. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and drying times.\n\n3. Clean and Maintain: Regularly clean the surface of your thin brick installation using a mild detergent and a soft brush or sponge. Avoid using abrasive cleaners that could damage the bricks or grout."
